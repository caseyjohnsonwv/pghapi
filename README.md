# PghAPI
Casey Johnson, October 2020

## About
A RESTful API built on the Python library FastAPI. This project is meant to familiarize me with API development and unit testing while building and deploying a useful service. The final product will allow users to save locations and receive travel time updates via SMS.

## Testing and Development
1. Create a Python virtual environment, such as `workingdir`.
2. `cd` into `workingdir`.
3. Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, `Scripts\activate.bat`; on Ubuntu, `source bin/activate`.
4. Run a `git clone https://github.com/caseyjohnsonwv/pghapi`.
5. `cd` into `pghapi`.
6. Install the project requirements from `requirements.txt`.
7. Run `pytest` with any optional arguments.
